# Outlier-detection-

This project is developed to automate the process of detecting outliers in agricultural data. The data has been collected from AgMarknet site. It's an enormous dataset spread across 7 years. Each year dataset contains 12 columns and approximately 30 lakh rows. Therefore, the code has been time and space optimised. Code has been written in Jupyter notebook.
